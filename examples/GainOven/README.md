If you haven't done the quick start tutorial 1 already, I would suggest you take a look at that first.

To run the StateSmith code gen, either use vscode or run the below commands in the `./CodeGen` directory.

They will work on any platform (windows, linux, mac).
```console
dotnet build CodeGen.csproj
dotnet ./bin/Debug/net6.0/CodeGen.dll
```

A summary of this tutorial's features are available in the examples directory [README.md](../README.md).

Enjoy!
